<h1>Password Generator</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The project consists of an imported string and random Python library. a function was created that passed in a length parameter equal to 12 alphanumeric characters. This would set the total length of each generated password. Two strings were concatenated within the function to create the password and set it to the characters variable. The characters variable is then joined with an empty string to create a new variable called password. This password variable gets returned and printed to the console.
